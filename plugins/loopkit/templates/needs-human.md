# needs-human.md — the open door

Work the loop is not confident enough to ship waits here for a human. One file,
newest section at the top, never a file per finding. Every edit to this file
pings the webhook in `LOOPKIT_NEEDS_HUMAN_WEBHOOK` (if set).

A section is answerable only if it carries all of:

1. A dated heading: `## <what is undecided> (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
2. What it blocks (spec slug, ticket, triage row source).
3. The question, stated so it can be answered yes/no or by picking an option —
   with the WHOLE context in the section: the facts, the figures, the files.
   The reader must not need a lookup.
4. The cost of EACH option, not one recommendation.

When the human rules, do not delete the section: prefix the heading with
`RESOLVED <date> —` (uppercase, so `inbox_to_triage.py` stops filing it) and
record the ruling under it. Then land the ruling as a durable artifact — a rule,
a hook pattern, a runbook, a test pin — in the same session.
